      <h3>The Unknown Sky, Digital Image, 2018</h3>
      <p> This is a digital image that was created in Adobe Photoshop. When I was first introduced to this project, the first thing that came up into my mind was to make a beautiful sunset, glitched because sunsets have a wide variety of colors that are present and I thought it would look cool if the sunset sky was glitched. The image I choose for this project was a found image on the internet. My relationship with this image is that I love sunsets and I think they are very pretty and it really shows the true beauty of this earth. Sunsets also remind me of Hawaii, which is also one of my favorite places to travel in the world. I corrupted this image by bringing it into audacity. In audacity, I distorted a small section of the image. Than I grabbed another section of the image and then inverted and faded out the image to finish the glitch. I then took a screenshot of my glitched image and brought it into photoshop and created small touch ups with the color balance adjustment tool and the hue and saturation tool of the image. The aspects I wanted to put emphasis on the art piece was the colors of the sky.</p>
